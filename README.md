# Cricsheet-analysis--Project2
This project is an analysis of cricket match data of IPL, T20, Test and ODI macthes. 
The data was sourced from the official website and was download in the form of JSON scripts. A nested loop was used to extract the data and store it in SQL database. Then a connection was established between SQL and Power Bi. The Power Bi dashboard showed analysis of the cricket data through multiple reports.
